Forage Tata GenAI Analytics Job Simulation
This repository contains my work and key learnings from the Forage Tata GenAI Analytics Job Simulation. This virtual experience provided a hands-on opportunity to act as an AI transformation consultant for Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ), the advanced analytics and AI center of excellence for the Tata Group.

Program Overview
The simulation centered around a real-world business problem: assisting a fictional financial services client, Geldium Finance, in reducing its high credit card delinquency rate. This involved leveraging generative AI and advanced data analytics to derive insights, build predictive models, and formulate a data-driven strategy.

Key Learnings and Skills Acquired
This program was instrumental in developing a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end data analytics lifecycle, with a specific focus on the application of Generative AI. The key skills and concepts I engaged with include:

Data Analytics and Insights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I learned to meticulously examine and understand a dataset to identify its primary characteristics, uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and check underlying assumptions. This foundational step was crucial for effective feature engineering and modeling.
Data Quality Assessment and Cleaning: I practiced techniques to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the analytical results.
GenAI for Data Insights: A significant part of the simulation involved using Generative AI tools to accelerate the process of uncovering insights from the data. This included generating hypotheses, identifying key drivers of delinquency, and summarizing complex data patterns into understandable narratives.
Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning

Feature Engineering: I gained experience in creating new features from the existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models.

Predictive Modeling: I was tasked with building and evaluating a predictive model to identify customers at a high risk of delinquency. This involved understanding and applying appropriate classification algorithms.

Model Evaluation and Selection: I learned to assess the performance of different models using various metrics and to select the most suitable model based on the business context and objectives.
Business Acumen and Strategy
Business Storytelling: The simulation emphasized the importance of translating complex analytical findings into a compelling narrative for a non-technical audience. I practiced crafting clear and concise business reports and presentations.

Data-Driven Recommendations: I learned how to move from insights to actionable recommendations, proposing a strategic approach for Geldium Finance to mitigate credit card delinquency.

Ethical AI and Responsible Automation: A key component of the program was the focus on designing and implementing AI systems responsibly. This included considerations for fairness, transparency, and the ethical implications of using AI in financial services.

AI-Driven Strategy Design: I was challenged to think strategically about how an AI-powered collections strategy could be implemented to engage high-risk customers in a fair, scalable, and effective manner.

Tasks Completed
The simulation was structured around a series of tasks that mirrored the workflow of a data analytics consultant:

Framing the Business Problem: Understanding the client's challenge and the project's objectives.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Diving deep into the provided dataset to understand customer demographics, financial behavior, and delinquency patterns.

Data-Driven Insights with GenAI: Utilizing generative AI to extract key insights and formulate initial hypotheses.
Predictive Model Development: Building and refining a model to predict customer delinquency.
Strategic Recommendations: Developing a comprehensive report and presentation outlining the findings, the predictive model, and a recommended data-driven collections strategy.

Ethical Considerations: Analyzing and addressing the potential ethical implications of the proposed AI solution.
Certificate of Completion
Upon successful completion of the program, I was awarded a certificate from Forage and Tata Group.
